CS361 Operating Systems assignment 

Note:
This system was developed utilizing the Juce API "Introjucer" application along with Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.

- To open the .jucer project file, you must use the Introjucer application (www.juce.com).
- There are project files generated for both Visual Studio 2015 and Codeblocks.
These project files can be found in their respective "Builds" folder.
If you have a requested C++ IDE you'd like a project file for, ask me and I should be able to occomodate via Introjucer.
